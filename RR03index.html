    		<p> Based on Laurel Schwulst’s perspective, Schwulst, advocates for individual websites over social media accounts because websites allow designers to be expressive, whereas, social media holds a specific structure. In her article, Schwulst states, “they allow the author to create not only works (the “objects”) but also the world (the rooms, the arrangement of rooms, the architecture!).” Meaning, designers create the guidelines for their websites, they are not permanent. In contrast to social media, most platforms, such as Instagram and Facebook have a steady structure that users follow, making this form of self-representation very limited. Platforms like Instagram, tailor your discovery feed based on specific interests to you as a user. In addition, Instagram will expose your account to other users who share similar interests as you, which, in my opinion makes it harder to reach a larger, more versatile audience.</p>
   			
   			<p> Additionally, I agree with Laurel Schwulst and her advocation of individual websites over social media. I believe that individual websites are a better form of self-representation and growth since it is something that is always expanding and never thoroughly complete. Websites can always be tailored and redesigned to your relevance as a designer, and it can always transform into something better. Individual websites provide freedom with how you present yourself, you make the rules and guidelines. Further, social media platforms come with a structured grid that the user must follow, this creates boundaries on what the designer can offer. For example, Instagram follows a three column grid and has a standard post dimension of 1080px by 1080px, that users are compelled to use and cannot alter.</p>

			<p> Individual websites contain a higher volume of flexibility and power in comparison to social media. Individual websites will help you build your brand and your business and it will be exposed to a wide variety of individuals who are dying to discover something new and innovative. Within a single web page, you can create a narrative that provides all of the information a client may need to see, upon request to collaborate. In addition, web analytics can give designers more business insight than any social media platform, as mentioned earlier, your social media platform is tailored to your needs and your profiles will have a limited audience. Whereas, web domains are opened to any one and can be viewed at any time. In contrast, most social media accounts will only appear to those who share similar interests as you, which in my opinion, hinders your chances of being exposed to others all around the world and gaining lifetime opportunities.</p>

    		<p>In my opinion, a website is like Rubik's cube; a small yet complexed form of activity, that awards you with a huge sense of accomplishment. When you start the process of decoding a Rubik’s cube it seems very complexed and almost impossible, after all of the trial and error and countless attempts to help solve the equation, everything comes quickly and naturally. At the end of the Rubik’s cube, you look at it and say to yourself, “wow, I really did that?”, and to me, that’s how web design works. You go through numerous rounds of experimentation along with endless phases of research and development, just to solve your own predicament. When you understand the variables and fundamentals of web design, that alone allows you to expand and be more experimental with your work.</p>
